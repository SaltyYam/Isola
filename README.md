# Isola
The Isolation board game in video game form.

This is my adaptation of the isola board game.

The game consits with a grid of 7 * 8 tiles,
on each turn a player need to move to one of the 8 adjacent tiles next to him; and then to block another tile on the board.
a player cannot move to a tile that has been blocked or onto a tile that the opponent is standing on.

The game concludes when one or both of the players can no longer move - every single adjacent tile is blocked.

I implemented the AI using the Minimax algorithem, whilst also using Alpha Beta pruning and A transposition table.

The zip file contains the java project of the game.
